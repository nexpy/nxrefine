<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>NXRefine implements a complete workflow for both data acquisition and
reduction of single crystal x-ray scattering collected by the sample
rotation method. NXRefine generates a three-dimensional mesh of
scattering intensity, <em>i.e.</em>, S(<strong>Q</strong>), which can be used either to
model diffuse scattering in reciprocal space or to transform the data to
produce three-dimensional pair-distribution-functions (PDF), which
represent the summed probabilities of all possible interatomic vectors
in real space, <em>i.e.</em>, Patterson maps. If the Bragg peaks are eliminated
before these transforms, using a process known as ‘punch-and-fill,’ only
those probabilities that deviate from the average crystalline structure
are retained, generating ‘difference’ Patterson, or 3D-ΔPDF, maps. The
final stage of the NXRefine workflow is to generate such 3D-ΔPDF maps.</p>
<p>The uncompressed raw data from such measurements comprises tens (and
sometimes hundreds) of gigabytes, often collected in under 30 minutes.
The speed of data collection allows such measurements to be repeated
multiple times as a function of a parametric variable, such as
temperature. Ideally, such data should be transformed into reciprocal
space as quickly as it is measured, so that scientists can inspect the
results before a set of scans is complete. For this reason, the NXRefine
workflow is designed to be run automatically once an initial refinement
of the sample orientation has been determined.</p>
<p>NXRefine is currently in use on Sector 6-ID-D at the Advanced Photon
Source and the QM2 beamline at CHESS.</p>
<div class="section" id="experimental-geometry">
<h2>Experimental Geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-geometry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>NXRefine is designed for experiments, in which the sample is placed in a
monochromatic x-ray beam and rotated continuously about a Φ-axis that is
approximately perpendicular to the beam. Images are collected on an area
detector placed in transmission geometry behind the sample. Detectors
such as the Dectris Pilatus series consist of a set of chips with small
gaps between them, so sample rotation scans are often repeated multiple
times (usually three) with small detector translations between each one
to fill in these gaps. However, it is also possible to accomplish this
just by adjusting the orientation of the Φ-axis itself. NXRefine reduces
the data independently for each rotation scan before merging them to
create a single 3D data volume.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><em>Experimental geometry used in NXRefine.</em></span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>The Φ-axis is approximately perpendicular to the beam. The Φ-axis motor
is on a χ-circle (not shown), with χ = 0° corresponding to a vertical
axis of rotation. The figure shows a configuration, in which χ = -90°.
The orientation of the Φ-axis can also be adjusted in the horizontal
plane by ω and in the vertical plane by θ.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This geometry is equivalent to the four-circle geometry
defined by H. You [see Fig. 1 in J. Appl. Cryst. <strong>32</strong>, 614
(1999)], with θ and ω corresponding to η and μ, respectively.
At present, NXRefine assumes that the two angles coupled to
the detector (δ and ν in You’s paper), are fixed to 0°, with
detector misalignments handled by the yaw and pitch angles
refined in powder calibrations.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>In earlier versions of NXRefine, θ was called the
goniometer pitch angle, since it corresponds to a tilting
or pitch of the goniometer’s χ-circle about the horizontal
axis. It is still referred to as ‘gonpitch’ in CCTW, the
C++ program called by NXRefine to transform the detector
coordinates to reciprocal space.</p>
</div>
<p>NXRefine uses the following conventions to define a set of Cartesian
coordinates as laboratory coordinates when all angles are set to 0.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>+X<sub>lab</sub>: parallel to the incident beam.</p></li>
<li><p>+Z<sub>lab</sub>: parallel to the (usually vertical) axis connecting the base of the
χ-circle to the sample.</p></li>
<li><p>+Y<sub>lab</sub>: defined to produce a right-handed set of coordinates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to defining the sample orientation, it is necessary to
relate the pixel coordinates of the detector to the instrument
coordinates. Assuming the pixels form a rectangular two-dimensional
array, the detector X-axis corresponds to the fastest-changing
direction, which is normally horizontal, so the orthogonal Y-axis is
usually vertical. The two coordinate systems are then related by:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">+X<sub>det</sub> = -Y<sub>lab</sub>, +Y<sub>det</sub> = +Z<sub>lab</sub>, and +Z<sub>det</sub> = -X<sub>lab</sub></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This orientation matrix to convert between these two coordinate
systems is defined by a setting describing the conversion as a string.
In the above example, the setting is “-y +z -x”.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Many detectors store images as TIFF or CBF files, with the origin
at the top-left corner. In those case, the y-axis is inverted, so
the appropriate setting should be “-y -z +x”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sample-orientation">
<h2>Sample Orientation<a class="headerlink" href="#sample-orientation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To transform data collected in this experimental geometry, it is
necessary to determine an orientation matrix using Bragg peaks measured
in the course of the sample rotation. With high-energy x-rays, the area
detector covers reciprocal space volumes that can exceed
10×10×10Å<sup>3</sup>. Depending on the size of the crystal unit cell,
such volumes contain hundreds, if not thousands, of Brillouin Zones.
NXRefine has a peak-search algorithm for identifying all the peaks above
a certain intensity threshold, which are then used to generate an
orientation matrix that is refined on many, if not all, Bragg peaks.</p>
<p>Each peak is defined by its coordinates on the detector, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_p\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_p\)</span>, and the goniometer angles <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span>,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\chi\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> defined in the figure above. These need to be
converted into reciprocal space coordinates, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{Q}(h,k,l)\)</span>, using an
orientation matrix. The conversion between detector coordinates and reciprocal
space coordinates is accomplished through a set of matrix operations.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbf{Q}(h,k,l) = \mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{U}^{-1}\mathcal{G}^{-1}
\frac{\left(\hat{\mathbf{d}}-\hat{\mathbf{x}}\right)}{\lambda}\]</div>
<p>where</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\mathbf{d}(x_{p}, y_{p})=\mathcal{D}\mathcal{O}^{-1}_{det}
\begin{pmatrix}{x_{p}-x_{c}}\\{y_{p}-y_{c}}\\0\end{pmatrix}-\mathcal{G}
\begin{pmatrix}{x_{s}-l_{sd}}\\{y_{s}}\\{z_{s}}\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{U}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> matrices are defined by
Busing and Levy in Acta Cryst. <strong>22</strong>, 457 (1967). <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> describe two sets of rotations:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\mathcal{G}(\theta,\omega,\chi,\phi)=\mathcal{R}^y(\theta)
\mathcal{R}^z(\omega)\mathcal{R}^x(\chi)\mathcal{R}^z(\phi)\\\mathcal{D}(\tau_{x},\tau_{y},\tau_{z})=\mathcal{R}^x(\tau_{x})
\mathcal{R}^y(\tau_{y})\mathcal{R}^z(\tau_{z})\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}^\alpha\)</span> are rotation matrices around axes,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha=x,y,z\)</span>, defined in the laboratory frame. The detector tilt
angles, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_x\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_y\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_z\)</span> are commonly known
as pitch, yaw, and roll, respectively.</p>
<p>All distances are defined in absolute units, <em>i.e.</em>, in the above equations,
the coordinates of the Bragg peaks, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_p\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_p\)</span>, and the beam
center, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_c\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_c\)</span> have been multiplied by the pixel sizes.
These coordinates are defined in the detector frame in which the <em>x</em> axis is
the direction of the fastest-moving pixel coordinates. By convention, this is
horizontal and the <em>y</em>-axis is vertical, <em>i.e.</em>, the origin of the pixel array
is in the lower-left corner. However, it is quite common for detector images to
be saved as TIFF or CBF files, in which the origin is in the upper-left corner,
<em>i.e.</em>, the <em>y</em>-axis points downward. To accommodate this situation, and to
handle other possible detector orientations, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span> matrix
converts between detector and laboratory frames.</p>
<p>So, for example, for the conventional detector orientation,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\mathcal{O} = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>whereas, when the <em>y</em>-axis is flipped</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\mathcal{O} = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1\\1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Currently, these matrices are defined in NXRefine settings files by
a single string, defining which laboratory axis are parallel to the
detector axes, <em>e.g.</em>, in the first example, “-y +z -x”. It is
possible to define detector orientation for an arbitrary orientation,
but this requires the (3x3) matrix to be manually defined in the
NeXus file.</p>
</div>
<p>The center of the sample, with respect to the goniometer center, is given by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_s\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_s\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z_s\)</span>, and the distance from the goniometer
center to the detector, at the point where the incident beam would intersect,
is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l_{sd}\)</span>. The incident beam wavelength is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>The position and orientation of the detector are originally estimated using a
powder calibrant. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> matrix is a function of the lattice
parameters, which are assumed to be approximately known in advance. In the
refinement process defined by NXRefine, an initial estimate of the orientation
matrix, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{U}\)</span>, is generated by selecting two peaks, whose
(<em>h</em>, <em>k</em>, <em>l</em>) values are assumed based on their <em>d</em>-spacings. This allows all
the other peaks to be assigned (<em>h</em>, <em>k</em>, <em>l</em>) indices. If these assignments
are reasonable, then the other peaks are used to refine both the instrumental
and sample parameters in order to minimize discrepancies between the calculated
and measured peak positions and optimize <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{U}\)</span>. If too few peaks
are assigned by the initial peak selection, it is necessary to select different
peaks.</p>
<p>The refinement process, along with the tools that NXRefine provide to
facilitate peak assignments, are described in a later section.</p>
