Experiment Setup
================
Data that is processed by the NXRefine package are stored as HDF5 files
stored according to the `NeXus format <http://www.nexusformat.org/>`_,
which is an international standard for the storage of x-ray and neutron
scattering data. NXRefine uses a hierarchical folder structure to
store both the experimental data, ingested from the raw data generated
on an x-ray beamline, and processed data generated by the data reduction
workflow. Scripts and plugins to the NeXpy GUI are used to facilitate
the creation of both the folder hierarchy and the NeXus files
themselves.

In the next section, we will describe the workflow used to both ingest
the raw data and transform it into reciprocal space coordinates and
pair-distribution-functions. In this section, we will describe the
framework, within which these processes function.

Experiment Files
----------------
NXRefine assumes that measurements on a set of samples can be grouped
together as a single experiment, typically scheduled within the same
time period. For example, measurements at synchrotron x-ray facilities
are often grouped by the proposal number used to acquire beam time, and
are therefore labelled by a proposal number and/or a run cycle. For
example, on beamline 6-ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source, measurements
resulting from Proposal No. GUP-75969 may be scheduled in a specific
run cycle, say 23-1, and stored in ``/data/GUP-75969-23-1``.

Here is the structure of an experiment directory::
