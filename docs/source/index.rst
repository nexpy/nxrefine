NXRefine
========
NXRefine implements a complete workflow for both data acquisition and 
reduction of single crystal diffuse x-ray scattering collected as a 
series of area detector frames during continuous sample rotation. The
data are stored in HDF5 files, which conform to the NeXus data format
standard.
